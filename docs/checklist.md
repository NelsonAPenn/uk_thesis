# Formatting checklist

This contains a list of common formatting issues to make sure work before publishing a PR. Many are from the graduate student checklist. 

When submitting a thesis, there are more items to check. This is a subset of items that are relevant to the template and documentclass.

## Pain points

These are highly likely to be affected by updates to the documentclass.

- No page numbers before Acknowledgements.
- Roman numerals must be used for the acknowledgment page and all pages following until the first page of the text. Begin with numeral " iii ".
- Arabic numerals must be used for the main text, illustrative material, appendices, references, and vita. Begin with page 1 and number consecutively. 
- There should NOT be a blank page before Chapter 1.
- The following should be bookmarked in PDF format:
  - Title page
  - Abstract
  - Acknowledgements
  - Table of Contents
  - List of Tables
  - List of Figures
  - Chapters
  - Subsections (minimized under chapter bookmarks)
  - Appendix
  - Bibliography/References
  - Vita
- Do not use chapter numbers for Appendix/ References (in TOC and the corresponding chapters)


## Others

- Check margins (1.5” on left, 1” on all other sides
- Page numbers should be 0.5" above the bottom of the page
- Font size must not  exceed 12 pts anywhere in document & must consistently remain the same size (inclusive of Headings and Subheadings)
- Figure heading should be on same page as figure
- Page order requirement:
  - Title page
  - Abstract
  - Approval page
  - Dedication
  - Acknowledgements
  - Table of Contents; Remove other pages prior to TOC not in this list
- Place page numbers in portrait position for landscape pages as in Technical FAQ and rotate landscape pages 90º clockwise so page number (in portrait position) appears on “left” margin
    - TODO: landscape pages need support
